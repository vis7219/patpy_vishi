):
    r"""Calculate the number, total lifetime and persistence pairs of the connected components in the kNN graph

    Computation is performed while stepwise filtering through the graph starting from the lowest
    value. In practice, if the vertex feature values correspond to e.g. disease severity,
    this function can be used to evaluate how connected components in the kNN graph change as
    the disease severity increases. This evaluates the connectivity of
    the sample representation with respect to the feature.

    Parameters
    ----------
    distances : square matrix, crs_matrix
        Matrix of distances between samples.
    conditions : array-like, numerical
        Numerical vector with the values of a feature for each sample.
    max_feature_difference : float
        Maximum difference in the feature values allowed between connected nodes.
    n_neighbors : int = 7
        Number of neighbors to use for constructing the kNN graph.
    order : str = "sublevel" or "superlevel"
        The order of the filtration. Either "subevel" to filter from the lowest to
        the highest value or "superlevel" to filter from the highest to the lowest value.
    infinity_value : str = "max" or float
        The maximium filtration value. It should be larger or equal to the maximum
        value of the condition. By default it is equal to the maximum value of the feature.
        If set to a float, it uses the specified value. Higher values increase the death coordinate
        and thus the lifetime of any components that remain after all edges have been included.

    Returns
    -------
    result : dict
        Result of the evaluation with the following keys:
        - n_components: int
            The number of connected components detected during the filtration. The lower the number,
            the better i.e. more connected the representation w.r.t. the condition.
        - total_lifetime: float
            The total lifetime of the connected components computed as \\sum_{i=2}^{n_components} (d_i - b_i).
            We disregard the lifetime of the first connected component as it is always equal to the
            difference between the maximum and minimum filtration value. The lower the total_lifetime,
            the better i.e. more connected the representation w.r.t to the condition.
        - persistence_pairs: list
            Persistence pairs of the form [[b_1, d_1], [b_2, d_2], ..., [b_N, d_N]] where
            b_i denotes the birth value at and d_i is the death value of a connected component
            and N is the number of connected components detected during the filtration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata : AnnData
        Annotated data object. Must contain ``adata.obsm[obsm_key]``.
    covariates : list[str]
        Categorical columns in ``adata.obs`` to test.
    obsm_key : str
        Key in ``adata.obsm`` containing the embedding to test against.
    n_components : int, default ``10``
        Number of components to test.
    test : {"anova", "kruskal"}
        Statistical test to use. ``"anova"`` runs a one-way F-test;
        ``"kruskal"`` runs a Kruskal-Wallis H-test (non-parametric
        alternative).
    component_label : str, optional
        Prefix used to name each component column in the output (e.g.
        ``"PC"`` → ``"PC1"``, ``"PC2"``; ``"Factor"`` → ``"Factor1"``).
        Defaults to ``"PC"`` when ``obsm_key`` contains ``"pca"`` and
        ``"Factor"`` when it contains ``"mofa"``, otherwise ``"Component"``.

    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        Tidy DataFrame with columns ``["covariate", "<component_label>",

        (covariate, component) pair.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``obsm_key`` is not found in ``adata.obsm``, a covariate column is
        missing from ``adata.obs``, or ``test`` is not a recognised value.
