## 0,16,5

### Added

- Interface to PILOT_GMA_VAE sample representation method at `patpy.tl.sample_representation.PILOTGMVAE`

### Fixed

- Added missing method references to the API docs

## 0.16.4

### Added

- `patpy.datasets.combat_stephenson`: harmonized COMBAT + Stephenson COVID-19 PBMC cohort (251 samples / 1,399,435 cells / 1,856 genes) with shared cell_coarse_aligned annotations and joint PCA/scVI/scANVI embeddings.
- `patpy.datasets.inflammation_atlas`: inflammation atlas cross-study dataset. Added only scANVI latents. 3 splits (main / external / validation) selected through a split argument, each with its own DatasetInfo (cell_type_key is Level1 for main, Level1pred for external/validation).

### Changed

- Turn off running dataset tests manually, they can now only be triggered manually

### Fixed

- Add locking scanpy test file to prevent concurrent reading and failing tests: https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/4097

## 0.16.3

### Fixed

- Downloading COMBAT meta adata did not work due to incorrect link for the programmatic access

## 0.16.2

### Changed

- Move tutorials to submodule. Adapted the CI process and updated contributor information

## 0.16.1

### Added

- `evaluate_representation(..., method="permanova")` for categorical outcomes: PERMANOVA pseudo-F (single factor, same decomposition as ``vegan::adonis2``) with permutation p-values in pure Python

### Changed

- Moved distances caching from anndata object to the instance of the sample representation class
- Renamed dataset loaders `combat_preprocessed`, `hlca_preprocessed`, `onek1k_preprocessed`, `stephenson_preprocessed`, `ticatlas_preprocessed` to `combat`, `hlca`, `onek1k`, `stephenson`, `ticatlas` (breaking; no deprecation aliases).

### Added

- `kind: Literal["raw", "processed"] = "processed"` argument on every dataset loader. Currently only the processed variants are wired up; `kind="raw"` raises `NotImplementedError` until raw URLs are provided.
- `load_metadata: bool = False` argument on `patpy.datasets.combat` that additionally downloads the ~4 MB sample-metadata `AnnData` (Figshare ID `64291092`) and returns it as an extra tuple element. Combined with `return_dataset_info`, the return order is `(adata, meta_adata, info)`.

### Deleted

- `DISTANCES_UNS_KEY` from sample representation methods
- `combat_preprocessed`, `hlca_preprocessed`, `onek1k_preprocessed`, `stephenson_preprocessed`, `ticatlas_preprocessed` (use `combat`, `hlca`, `onek1k`, `stephenson`, `ticatlas` instead).

## 0.16.0 – datasets module

### Added

- `datasets` module with functions to download preprocessed datasets
- `patpy/datasets/_datasets/DatasetInfo` data class to define information about datasets
- `patpy/datasets/_datasets/_load_dataset` util function
- `patpy/datasets/_datasets/combat_preprocessed` dataset
- `patpy/datasets/_datasets/stephenson_preprocessed`
- `patpy/datasets/_datasets/hlca_preprocessed` dataset
- `patpy/datasets/_datasets/onek1k_preprocessed` dataset
- `patpy/datasets/_datasets/ticatlas_preprocessed` dataset
- Tests for loading datasets `tests/test_datasets.py`
- Github workflow at `.github/workflows/test.yaml` with caching to not download datasets each time

## 0.15.4

### Fixed

- `patpy.tl.evaluation.replicate_robustness` normalisation: the metric now reaches 0 in the worst case (replicate is the farthest neighbour for every sample).

### Added

- Tests for `replicate_robustness` covering best, worst, and intermediate configurations.
- Expanded docstring for `replicate_robustness`.

## 0.15.3

### Fixed

- The `n_neighbors` and `reverse_technical_score` parameters in `patpy.tl.evaluation/knn_prediction_score` were not used

### Added

- Tests for the fixed bugs

## 0.15.2

### Deleted

- Git dependencies `pulsar` and `pascient` to fix PyOI integration, changed installation instructions

## 0.15.1

### Added — `patpy.tl.condition_utils`

New module providing utilities for running any pertpy differential method
across all pairwise contrasts of a multi-dimensional condition space.

- **`run_condition_combinations(model_cls, adata, condition_cols, **kwargs)`** — one-liner that takes any pertpy class with a `compare_groups` classmethod, enumerates all observed pairwise condition contrasts, runs the model for each, and returns a concatenated DataFrame with a `"contrast"` column.
- **`ConditionComparison(model_cls, **defaults)`** — thin class wrapper around the above; stores the model class and default kwargs so the same configuration can be reused across multiple datasets or condition axes via `.run()`.
- **`build_condition_combinations(adata, condition_cols)`** — returns a DataFrame of all *observed* (not Cartesian) combinations of multiple condition columns, with a joined `"label"` column.
- **`build_all_pairwise_contrasts(adata, condition_cols)`** — returns a list of `{group, baseline, label}` dicts for every pairwise contrast of observed condition combinations.
- **`filter_adata_to_conditions(adata, condition_col, groups)`** — subsets an AnnData to cells belonging to specific condition groups.

## 0.15.0

### Added

- **`PaSCient`** method wrapper (`tl/supervised/PaSCient`) for training and fine-tuning PaSCent foundational model
- Example of running paSCient to `docs/notebooks/supervised_methods_example.ipynb`

## 0.13.0

### Added

- **`SupervisedSampleMethod`** base class (`tl/_base_sample_method.py`) providing a shared scaffold for unsupervised and supervised sample-level methods.

  multi-instance mixed model by Engelmann et al. 2024
  (<https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02455>).
- **`PULSAR`** wrapper (`tl/supervised/_pulsar.py`) for the zero-shot foundation model by Pang et al. 2025 (<https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.24.685470>).
- Tests for all supervised methods in `tests/test_supervised_methods.py`,
  including fixtures with deterministic mock backends (no network access or
  GPU required), multi-label MixMIL tests, and PULSAR linear probe tests.
- Base class for sample methods: (`tl/_base_sample_method/BaseSampleMethod`)
- `fit_linear_probe()` method for sample-level methods
- `fine_tune()` method for supervised sample-level methods with linear probing as a default
